# Bank-Customer-Churn-Model

## Introduction

This repository contains the code and resources for my data science & machine learning internship project at YBI Foundation. The project aims to develop a bank customer churn model using data science techniques and machine learning algorithms.

## Project Overview

In this project, I worked as a data science & machine learning intern at YBI Foundation to develop a bank customer churn model. The main objectives of the project were:

1. Perform data encoding and feature scaling for preparing the dataset.
2. Handle the issue of imbalanced data using random under-sampling and random over-sampling techniques.
3. Implement a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for churn prediction.
4. Use Grid Search for hyperparameter tuning to improve the model's performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is  provided in this repository. However, you can use your own dataset with similar features for this analysis. Ensure that your dataset has the necessary features required for building a customer churn model.

## Data Preprocessing

Explain the steps involved in data preprocessing. For example:

- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical features
- Scaling numerical features

## Feature Engineering

Explain the feature engineering techniques used in the project, if any. For example:

- Creating new features based on domain knowledge
- Extracting useful information from existing features

## Model Building

Explain the implementation of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier and the hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search.

## Evaluation

Describe how the model's performance was evaluated, including the metrics used (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).

## Results

Provide an overview of the results obtained from the model. You can include visualizations or tables to showcase the model's performance.

## Future Improvements

Suggest potential areas of improvement for the project. For example:

- Trying other machine learning algorithms
- Using more advanced techniques for handling imbalanced data
- Collecting additional relevant features to improve model predictions
